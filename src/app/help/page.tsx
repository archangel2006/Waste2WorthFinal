    {
        question: "What kind of food can I donate?",
        answer: "You can donate anything from fresh produce and cooked meals to packaged goods. Our AI system will help you categorize the donation as 'Edible' (for humans), 'Usable' (for animals), or 'Compost'.",

    {
        question: "How does the pickup and delivery work?",
        answer: "Once a donation is claimed by an organization, our network of volunteer transporters is notified. A volunteer can then schedule a pickup and deliver the donation directly to the organization.",

        question: "How do I become a volunteer or an organization?",
        answer: "Simply choose your desired role during the sign-up process. As an organization, you'll be able to claim donations. As a volunteer, you'll be able to transport them.",
